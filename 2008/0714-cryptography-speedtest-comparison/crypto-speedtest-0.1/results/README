This directory contains speed test result data sets from five different
computers and five different Linux distributions that are available to me. This
file contains a description of the test environments. All tests were run with a
minimal set of process (usually just init and a shell) running in
background. Tests were performed around 2008-04-09 with up-to-date distribution
packages.

*** CPUs / Computers ***

** p4-3200 **

is an Intel Pentium 4 clocked at 3.2 GHz with 1024 KB level 2 cache. It has
give different distributions installed: gentoo (base) and chrooted:
debian-etch, debian-lenny, ubuntu-gutsy and fedora 8.

** p3-1000 **

is an Intel Pentium 3 Mobile clocked at 1.0 GHz with 512 KB level 2 cache. The
installed base distribution is (K)Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon (currently the
stable).

** ath-2000 **

is an AMD Athlon XP 2000+ with 256 KB level 2 cache. It has Debian etch
(currently the stable) installed in a chroot.

** cel-2660 **

is an Intel Celeron clocked at 2.66 GHz with 256 KB level 2 cache. It has
Debian etch (currently the stable) installed.

** p2-300 **

is an older Intel Pentium 2 (Klamath) clocked at 300 MHz with 512 KB level 2
cache. It also has only Debian etch installed.

*** Distributions ***

*** gentoo ***

The speedtest was performed using the following ebuilt library versions. All
where compiled using portage with:

CFLAGS="-march=i686 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

ebuild package versions used in speedtest:

dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.4.0-r1

dev-libs/nettle-1.15
dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8g
dev-libs/beecrypt-4.1.2-r1
dev-libs/libtomcrypt-1.06

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

Libtomcrypt is currently not included in Debian lenny, however a new package
which is being prepared for inclusion in Debian is available from:

The source package was built using the ubuntu system and the resulting binary
debs installed.

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

gcc			4.1.2-33

gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-33)

*** Results ***

All available CPU / Distribution combinations were tested and the result text
files are included in this package. The results are fed into the gnuplot script
"speedtest.gnuplot" which produces two PDFs per result directory.

Each <cpu>-<distro>.pdf contains 23 pages comparing ciphers and cryptography
libraries. The second <cpu>-<distro>-all.pdf is a A4-sized plot containing
_all_ ciphers in _all_ libraries making the graph very full.

Furthermore this directory contains a sidebyside-comparison.pdf, which collect
each of the 23 different plots from the 9 different CPU / distro combinations
and displays all 9 plots on a A4-sized page. This enables quick comparison of
the different architectures.

The file cpu-sidebyside-comparison-3x2.pdf contains only 6 six of the different
CPU / distro combinations excluding distros on p4-3200 to increase legibility.
