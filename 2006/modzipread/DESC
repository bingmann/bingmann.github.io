WHAT IS IT
Mod ZipRead is an Apache 2 module to browser Zip Archives. It uses zziplib.

WEBSITE
http://modzipread.sourceforge.net/

FEATURES
My main use is to browse archived Web sites (in Zip format) without extracting
them on my disk.  The module can parse a Zip file (with zziplib) and show the
contents.

There is a very crude support for index.html/index.htm files. So if a file
named index.html OR index.htm is found in the current directory, it is sent.

You can use the directive "ZipReadDirIndex" to set the exact list of
"index.html" files. This directive is similar to "DirectoryIndex"

The module use the Apache API to detect the mime-type of files and send it
correctly. (that means that, besides html, every file type (like image, pdf,
...) will be posted correctly).

REQUIREMENTS

This software is currently working on Debian GNU/Linux (i386) with Apache
2.0.47 and zziplib 0.10.76.
It should work on any system that support Apache 2.0.45+ and zziplib.

INSTALL

Just download the files from the CVS and type

  make
  make install

You need to have the apache2-dev and zziplib-dev packages installed 
Afterwards, you must add these lines to your Apache configuration to activate
the module :

  LoadModule zipread_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_zipread.so
  AddHandler zipread .zip

You may want to adjust the LoadModule directive to reflect where your Apache
modules are.
