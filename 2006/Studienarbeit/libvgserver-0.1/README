 
This directory contains the graph data management library libvgserver.

The RTree.h contains a class construct, which trigger strange errors when
compiled with g++ 3.3. Use g++ 3.4 or higher.

To compile it, the boost library from http://www.boost.org/ is required. On
Debian 3.1 it is packaged as libboost-dev. SuSE contains a package named
boost-devel. Any boost version later than 1.32 will work.

The testsuite of libvgserver also requires cppunit. The configure script will
auto-detect it's presence, so no manual setting is needed. If cppunit is not
installed, the testsuite is not built.

The compilation process can be run by:

$ ./configure --enable-optimize
--enable-optimize sets -O3 and -NDEBUG
check if autoconf shows any bad errors

$ make
get some coffee

The library is built as libvgserver.a and libvgclient.a.
