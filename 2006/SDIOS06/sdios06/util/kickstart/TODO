- Check for overlapping memory regions

  The memcopy function (or its invoking function) could check against
  the module memory ranges in MBI.mods.  The ELF loader updates the
  mods structure as it loads the three initial files.

  An extended version could attempt to resolve conflicts by moving
  memory around
