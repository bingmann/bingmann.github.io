QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSIX COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS

* Extract the tarball and change into the stxxl root directory.

* Adjust make.settings.gnu (or create make.settings.local and set the
  override values there) to match your local setup, especially consider
  the following variables:

  - STXXL_ROOT: the absolute path to the extracted STXXL sources
  - USE_BOOST and BOOST_ROOT: if you want to use the Boost libraries
  - MCSTL_ROOT: if you want to use the MCSTL library
  - COMPILER: if you want to use a non-default compiler

* Compile the library:

  - non-parallel:         make library_g++
  - with mcstl:           make library_g++_mcstl
  - with parallel mode:   make library_g++_pmode

* Compile the test programs (optional)

  - non-parallel:         make tests_g++
  - with mcstl:           make tests_g++_mcstl
  - with parallel mode:   make tests_g++_pmode
