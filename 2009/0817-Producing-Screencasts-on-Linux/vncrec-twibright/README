Twibright vncrec
================

This is basically a patched VNC from AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. Contains a
patched VNC viewer that allows record (-record), playback (-play), and video
export (-movie) of VNC sessions. The license is GPL (LICENCE.TXT).

> VNC server - you need to have a VNC server on this or other machine to
  be able to use vncrec. GPL Examples:
  TightVNC http://www.tightvnc.com/
  RealVNC http://realvnc.com/
  x11vnc http://freshmeat.net/projects/x11vnc/
  OSXvnc http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=64523&filename=VineServer2.1.dmg
  
To build vncrec, do:
  % xmkmf
  % make World

Set up the VNC server so you can view with VNC viewer. Then you can record a
VNC session "video":

  % vncrec -record sample.vncrec

Later, you can play it back by:

  % vncrec -play sample.vncrec

Encode the session quickly into a 4:2:0 Y'CbCr YUV4MPEG2 video stream to
stdout (this format can be played directly by mplayer, encoded into lots
of formats using transcode, or encoded into Ogg Theora using the example
encoder in libtheora):

  % vncrec -movie sample.vncrec

The sample rate of the movie is 10 by default or overriden by
VNCREC_MOVIE_FRAMERATE environment variable, or 10 if not specified. Some
formats (MPEG) don't have 10 so you must supply some more common number (24,
25,...).

> No sound: remove the $1.wav mention from the following scripts

> Sound: download Audacity http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/ plug the
  microphone in at the same time you start vncrec (synchronizing click), then
  cut the track off on the click, export into *.wav 
  
> Encoding into Theora: download libtheora http://www.theora.org/

Example encode line for Theora:
vncrec -movie $1.vnc | \
	/home/user/libtheora-1.0alpha7/examples/encoder_example \
	-o $1.ogg $1.wav -

> Encoding into MPEG4 ASP ("DivX"), Real Video, WMV: download transcode
  http://www.transcoding.org/cgi-bin/transcode?Download

Example encode script for MPEG4 ASP, MSMPEG4, MSMPEG4v2, MPEG4, Real Video 10,
WMV 7, WMV8:

pipe=$1.y4m
rm -f $pipe
/home/clock/vncrec-0.2/vncrec/vncrec -movie $1.vnc > $pipe
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y xvid -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o $1_mpeg4_asp.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F msmpeg4 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o \
	$1_msmpeg4.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F msmpeg4v2 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o \
	$1_msmpeg4v2.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F mpeg4 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o $1_mpeg4.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F rv10 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o $1_rv10.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F wmv1 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o $1_wmv7.avi
transcode -x yuv4mpeg -y ffmpeg -F wmv2 -i $pipe -p $1.wav -o $1_wmv8.avi
rm $pipe
