vncrec 0.4
==========

This is basically a patched VNC from AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. Contains a
patched VNC viewer that allows record (-record), playback (-play), and video
export (-movie) of VNC sessions. The license is GPL (LICENCE.TXT).

> VNC server - you need to have a VNC server on this or other machine to
  be able to use vncrec. GPL Examples:
  TightVNC http://www.tightvnc.com/
  RealVNC http://realvnc.com/
  x11vnc http://freshmeat.net/projects/x11vnc/
  OSXvnc (Vine Server) http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc/files/

To build vncrec, do:
  % xmkmf
  % make World

Set up the VNC server so you can view with VNC viewer. Then you can record a
VNC session "video":

  % vncrec -record out.vnc

Later, you can play it back by:

  % vncrec -play out.vnc

See http://panthema.net/2014/vncrec/#ffmpeg for information on how to use
"vncrec -movie" and ffmpeg to produce high-quality screencast movies.
