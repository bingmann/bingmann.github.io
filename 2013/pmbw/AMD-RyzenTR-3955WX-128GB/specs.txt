This is a workstation for FEA simulations, where per-core RAM bandwidth is imperative (and hyperthreading just slows things down). 
It turned out to be 4-5 times faster than the Core i7-10700 it replaced, much thanks to its 3800 GB/s peak RAM bandwidth.

CPU = AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3955WX 16-core (HT disabled)
Base clock = 3.9 GHz, peak = 4.3 GHz, TDP 280 W.

Motherboard = ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WiFi. 
Eight RAM channels.

RAM = 8 sticks of 16 GB = 128 GB DDR4-3200 each, all running at 1600 MHz.
CAS = 24, RAS-CAS = 22, RAS pre = 22, tRAS = 52, tRC = 74 (all default and stock)

RAID 10 with 4 NVMe SSDs, Quadro M4000 probably not affecting scores.
