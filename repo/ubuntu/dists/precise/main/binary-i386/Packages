Description: Text editor with integrated strong cryptographic functions.
 CryptoTE is a text editor based on the popular Scintilla editing
 widget. It saves sensitive text data in container files using strong
 encryption. This way private data cannot be read by other possibly
 malicious programs on a system. Compared to other "password keeper"
 programs, CryptoTE does not force any structure upon your data: it
 works with plain ASCII text and does not require you to fill in
 grids, key-value attributes, descriptions etc. Encryption is
 transparently performed using the highly-secure Serpent cipher. The
 editing interface is thoroughly optimized for speed and ease of
 use. Multiple subfiles, Quick-Find and a two-click random password
 generator make daily use very convenient.

Description: Tool to read, verify and update MD5 or SHA digest files.
 digup is a tool to update md5sum or shasum digest files. It will read
 existing digest files, check the current directory for new, updated,
 modified, renamed or deleted files and query the user with a summary
 of changes. After reviewing the updates, they can be written back to
 the digest file.
